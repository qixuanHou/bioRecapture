(CPu), and globus pallidus (GP) (C,D), and the frontal cortex (E,F). Regions marked with a double arrow in (A) indicate the presence of 5HT2A
labeling in the piriform cortex. A higher magniﬁcation of the region in (A) that is marked with an arrowhead is shown in (B), and indicates that 5HT2A
immunolabeling was present in cell bodies and ﬁbers of neurons in medial-anterior olfactory nuclei (AOM). 5HT2A immunolabeling in the intersecting
region of GP and CPu in (C) is shown at higher magniﬁcation in (D): several neurons (indicated by arrows) in GP and CPu have cell bodies and ﬁbers
labeled by 5HT2A receptors. Layer V in (E) and (F) exhibited dense labeling of 5HT2A receptors. Pyramidal cells in layer V of the frontal cortex (E)
are shown at a higher magniﬁcation in (F). Both the somata and the apical dendrites (indicated by arrows) of pyramidal cells in layer V were highly
labeled by 5HT2A receptors (F). Scale bar: 200 mm in (A); 80 mm in (C); 100 mm in (E); 20 mm in (B), (D), and (F).

Fig. 1. Loss of GFAP protein results in decreased synaptosomal cortical and hippocampal D-aspartate uptake. (A) Total protein was isolated from the cortex,
cerebellum, and hippocampus of adult age-matched GFAP null and wild type mice. Western blots were probed with an anti-GFAP antibody. Protein (90 Ag)
was loaded per lane. In all areas tested, no GFAP immunoreactivity was observed in the total protein fractions from the GFAP null animals. A nonspecific band
at 37 kD demonstrates that equal amounts of protein were loaded per lane. (B) Summary of D-aspartate synaptosomal uptake analysis. Six animals were used
per genotype; error bars represent S.D. and statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA analysis, p < 0.05. (C) Nonlinear regression analysis of
cortical synaptosomal D-aspartate uptake from GFAP null and wild type mice. There was a 30% decrease in the Vmax for D-aspartate uptake in the GFAP null
mice compared to control animals. (D) Eadie – Hofstee analysis of cortical synaptosomal D-aspartate uptake from GFAP null and wild type mice. Although
there is a significant reduction in the Vmax of D-aspartate uptake in the cortex of GFAP null mice, there was no change in the Km.

Fig. 2. Western blot analysis of EAAT1 – 3 total protein expression in the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus of GFAP null and wild type mice. (A) Total
protein was isolated from the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus of adult age-matched GFAP null and wild type (B6129/J) mice, and 90 Ag of each total
protein preparation was loaded per lane. There was an increase in EAAT1 total protein expression in the cortical preparations from GFAP null animals
compared to wild type mice. In GFAP null animals, astrocytic EAAT2 protein levels were significantly increased in the cerebellum and hippocampus compared
to wild type levels. EAAT3 total protein expression was decreased in the hippocampus of GFAP null animals compared to control. (B) Optical densities were
determined for the immunoreactive bands resulting from EAAT1 – 3 Western blot analysis of total protein fractions from adult age-matched GFAP null and wild
type animals. The optical density measurements for EAAT protein immunoreactivities included the bands from the monomer and aggregate forms. The results
are expressed as a ratio of glutamate transporter to actin optical densities to account for any differences in lane loading. The experiments were repeated with six
animals per genotype; error bars present S.D. and statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test for independent means, p < 0.001.
(C) The linearity of chemiluminescence detection was determined by loading increasing concentrations of protein and probing with actin or EAAT1 – 3
transporter antibodies. The graph is a summary of results from five independent blots and demonstrates the linearity in the concentrations chosen for analysis.
The antibody used in this figure is anti-EAAT1. (D) Total protein (90 Ag) from the cortices of C57Bl/6J, GFAP null and B6129/J F2 mice were analyzed by
Western blot analysis using an anti-EAAT1-specific antibody. The results demonstrate that the increases in EAAT1 protein expression detected in the GFAP
null cortex are independent of genetic background.

Fig. 3. Immunohistochemical analysis of EAAT1 – 3 glutamate transporter distribution in the CNS of GFAP null and wild type (B6129/J F2) mice. EAAT1
expression is more abundant in the GFAP null cortex compared to wild type, while EAAT2 expression is elevated in the GFAP null hippocampus compared to
wild type. Distribution of EAAT3 is altered in the GFAP null hippocampus compared to wild type, and immunofluorescence microscopy was used to further
analyze the altered distribution of EAAT3 in the GFAP null CNS.

Fig. 4. Western blot analysis of synaptosomal EAAT1 – 3 glutamate transporter expression. (A) Synaptosomes were isolated from the cortex, cerebellum, and
hippocampus of adult age-matched GFAP null and wild type mice, and 90 Ag of each synaptosomal protein preparation was loaded per lane. EAAT1
synaptosomal protein levels were reduced in the cortex of GFAP null mice compared to wild type animals, while astrocytic EAAT2 synaptosomal protein levels
were increased in the cerebellum of the GFAP null animals compared to wild type. After probing with the glutamate transporter subtype-specific antibody, blots
were reprobed with an antisynaptophysin antibody to control for lane loading artifacts. (B) Optical densities were determined for the immunoreactive bands
resulting from EAAT1 – 3 Western blot analysis of synaptosomal protein from adult age-matched GFAP null and wild type animals. The results are expressed as
a ratio of glutamate transporter to synaptophysin optical densities to account for any differences in lane loading. The experiments were repeated with six
animals per genotype; error bars represent S.D. and statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test for independent means, p < 0.001.

Fig. 5. Immunohistochemical analysis of EAAT3 distribution in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum of age-matched adult GFAP null and wild type
(B6129/J F2) mice. First-column sections (from left, panels A, E, I, L, O) were probed with an anti-EAAT3 antibody and counterstained using a rabbit IgG
FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Second-column sections (panels B, F, J, M, P) were probed with an anti-Map2 antibody that labels dendrites and some
neuronal cell bodies and were counterstained using a mouse IgG Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. Third-cloumn sections (panels C, G, K, N, Q) are
composite images of the corresponding FITC and Cy3 stained sections. (A – D) Wild type (B6129/J F2) hippocampus; (E – H) GFAP null hippocampus.
Enlargement of the composite image in (C) and (G), as indicated by the boxed regions, demonstrates that EAAT3 is localized in both the cell body and
dendrites of wild type animals (D). In contrast, EAAT3 is clustered in the cell body of GFAP null hippocampal pyramidal cells and is absent from the proximal
dendrites (H). (I – K) Wild type cerebellum; (L – N) GFAP null cerebellum. Arrows indicate colocalization of both Map2 and EAAT3 in the dentrites of
cerebellar Purkinje cells from both the wild type and GFAP null mice. (O – Q) GFAP null cortex. The boxed area in (Q) is enlarged in (R) to demonstrate the
colocalization of Map2 and EAAT3 immunoreactivities in the dendrites of cortical neurons from GFAP null mice. The above results demonstrate that changes
in EAAT3 trafficking are limited to the GFAP hippocampus. Scale bars for (G), (N), (Q): 75 Am . Scale bars for (H) and (R): 3.5 Am.

Fig. 6. Surface expression of EAAT2 in GFAP null and wild type cortical astrocytes before and dibutyryl cAMP treatment. (A) Cortical astrocytes were isolated
from the cortex of GFAP null and wild type mice 1 – 4 days old. Astroctyes were grown in culture to 80% confluence prior to treatment for 10 days with 250
AM dibutyryl cAMP. Cells were surface biotinylated prior to harvesting and lysis. Part of the fraction was further biotinylated for total protein analysis prior to
immunoprecipitation with an anti-EAAT2 antibody. Western blot analysis demonstrates an upregulation of surface EAAT2 expression in wild type cortical
astrocytes following dBcAMP treatment. In contrast, GFAP null cortical astrocytes demonstrated no EAAT2 surface expression following dBcAMP treatment.
EAAT2 total protein levels were induced in both wild type and GFAP null astrocytes following dBcAMP treatment. Experiments were repeated five times with
five different cultures for each genotype. Five times the amount of immunoprecipitated product was loaded for surface fractions from GFAP null animals to
determine if levels of EAAT2 protein had been decreased below detectable levels normally observed with a 5 Al loading sample. (B) Immunohistochemical
analysis of primary astrocyte cultures from wild type (B6129/J F2) and GFAP null animals, probed with an anti-EAAT2 specific antibody, demonstrate that
EAAT2 is localized in intracellular clusters in the GFAP null astrocytes both before and after dBcAMP treatment. This is in contrast to the more dispersed
distribution of EAAT2 in wild type astrocytes. Scale bar: 1.5 Am.

The ages of the subjects are indicated in parentheses. Note that GFAP levels from depressed
subjects in the younger and middle age pairs are markedly lower than those in control

Astrocytes and Müller cells, the two macroglial cells of the retina, are shown in this schematic
of the mammalian retina. Astrocytes are confined largely to the nerve fiber layer at the vitreal
(inner) border of the retina. Müller cells, specialized radial glial cells found only in the retina,
span much of the retinal depth, from the vitreal border to the photoreceptor layer. The principal
neurons of the retina are illustrated, as are the recording and stimulating electrodes used in
experiments to monitor glial cell modulation of neuronal spiking.

Fig. 2.
Propagation of Ca2+ waves through astrocytes and Müller cells in the rat retina. A: A Ca2+
wave propagates through both astrocytes and Müller cells following mechanical stimulation
of an astrocyte soma (asterisk). A as well as B, D, and E are pseudocolor Ca2+ ratio images
that show Ca2+ increases within glial cells. B: In the presence of 100 μM suramin, a purinergic
receptor antagonist, stimulation of an astrocyte (asterisk) evokes a Ca2+ wave that propagates
through several astrocytes but fails to propagate into neighboring Müller cells. C: Stimulation
of glial cells on the retinal surface evokes ATP release, detected by the luciferin-luciferase
chemiluminescence assay. Five line scans show the spatial pattern of ATP chemiluminescence
at the indicated times after stimulation. D: Superfusate flow across the retinal surface (from
left to right) causes asymmetric propagation of a Ca2+ wave. E: Addition of suramin eliminates
the asymmetry despite continued superfusate flow. A, B, D, and E reproduced from Newman
(2001b); C from Newman (2003).

Glial modulation of light-evoked spiking in rat ganglion cells. Enhancement of neuron spiking
(A) and depression of spiking (B) are illustrated in recordings from two different neurons. A
frequency plot of spike activity (top trace) and Ca2+ levels within glial cells adjacent to the
neuron (bottom trace) are shown for each trial. Arrows indicate initiation of the glial Ca2+
wave. The bar at the bottom shows the repetitive light stimulus that evoked neuronal spiking.
Reproduced with modification from Newman and Zahs (1998).

Fig. 4.
Glial release of ATP inhibits rat ganglion cells. A: Ejection of ATPγS onto the retinal surface
evokes a Ca2+ increase in glial cells and a hyperpolarization (current-clamp recording) and an
outward current (voltage-clamp recording) in a neighboring ganglion cell. B: Stimulation of
glial cells with ATPγS evokes an inhibitory outward current in a ganglion cell. Addition of
AOPCP, an ectonucleotidase inhibitor that blocks conversion of AMP to adenosine, reduces
and slows the time course of the current. The effect is largely reversible. C: Addition of
DPCPX, an A1 adenosine receptor antagonist, abolishes the outward neuronal current evoked
by ATPγS stimulation of glial cells. D: Adenosine ejection evokes a larger, shorter latency
current in a neuron than does ATPγS ejection at the same retinal location. Reproduced from
Newman (2003).

Glial modulation of synaptic transmission by glutamate transport and release of D-serine. A:
Inhibition of the glial glutamate transporter by PDC greatly increases the amplitude and
duration of a light-evoked EPSC recorded from a ganglion cell in the salamander retina. Both
the ON and the OFF components of the light response are potentiated. B: Addition of D-serine,
an NMDA receptor coagonist, potentiates the inward current recorded from a rat ganglion cell
in response to NMDA ejection. C: Addition of D-amino acid-oxidase, which degrades D-
serine, reduces the inward current evoked by NMDA ejection. A reproduced from Higgs and

signs were observed. (c) After 2 h 30 min (ATP 20% of control)
distinct morphological changes were observed in random cells or small
clusters of cells. The nuclei became visible and appeared small, dark
and round to oval shaped (arrows). (d) After 3 h (ATP 3% of control)
the number of cell displaying such pyknotic nuclei had increased. The
nuclei of these additional cells are indicated by arrowheads. Note that
these cells (arrowhead) are neighboring the cells that ﬁrst appeared

Fig. 4 The gap junction blocker Cbx induced a concentration-
dependent, earlier onset of
the IA-induced ATP decrease. When
combining IA (30 lM) with 100 lM Cbx, the 50% reduction in ATP was
brought forward by approximately 1 h. The inactive Cbx analogue,
glycyrrhizic acid (Gza; 100 lM), did not inﬂuence the effect of IA. Data
points indicate mean ± SEM (n ¼ 3–7).

Fig. 5 The potency of Cbx in blocking gap junction communication
during IA-induced metabolic depression was attenuated over time in a
concentration dependent manner. This was shown in dye transfer
experiments using two different gap junction permeable dyes. (a) Dye
transfer of neurobiotin (MW 287.4) was completely blocked for up to
1 h, after which the effect of 20 lM Cbx was signiﬁcantly attenuated.
After 2 h of IA treatment, a limited but signiﬁcant neurobiotin transfer
occurred also in cultures treated with 100 lM Cbx. (b) Dye transfer of
Lucifer yellow (MW 442.8) was effectively blocked by Cbx up to 2 h.
From this time point a signiﬁcant transfer of Lucifer yellow occurred in
cultures treated with 20 and 50 lM Cbx. Shown in right panels are
examples of neurobiotin (a) and Lucifer yellow (b) dye transfer during
conditions of full gap junction communication (control; top) and com-
plete gap junction blockage (8 min 100 lM Cbx exposure; bottom).
Scale bars are 100 lm. All values were related to dye spreading in
control cultures and error bars indicate mean ± SEM (n ¼ 3–5). Sta-
tistical comparisons to evaluate possible attenuation of the Cbx effect
were performed between treated groups and a complete gap junction
blocking paradigm (100 lM Cbx for 8 min, n ¼ 5) using ANOVA followed
by Dunnett’s posthoc test
for multiple comparisons. p-values
< 0.05, < 0.01 and < 0.005 were considered statistically signiﬁcant
and were denoted *, ** and ***, respectively.

Fig. 6 Apoptotic events, phosphatidylserine exposure and chromatine
condensation, were visualized by binding of Annexin V (green) and
bright Hoechst 33258 nuclei staining (blue). The Hoechst staining was
also used for quantiﬁcation of the total cell number. (a) After 2 h of IA
treatment, Annexin V positive cells appeared as single cells or in small
clusters. (b) At 2 h 15 min the clusters had enlarged and thus included
a larger number of Annexin V positive cells. (c) After 2 h 30 min large
areas of cells were Annexin V positive. Chromatin condensation now
appeared as bright Hoechst staining within the Annexin V positive
clusters (inset; 6c). (d) The increase of Annexin V positive cells
occurred in parallel to the ATP decrease. Left ordinate and curve show
the ATP decrease during the metabolic depression (mean ± SEM, n ¼
3–23). Bars and right ordinate illustrate the increase in Annexin V
positive cells, calculated as the percent positive cells of the total cell
number in a microscopic ﬁeld (mean ± SEM, n ¼ 3–7). Subdivisions in
bars illustrate how the positive cells (% of all Annexin V positive cells)
distribute into clusters of deﬁned sizes. Scale bar in a–c is 100 lm.

Fig. 7 Cbx (100 lM) inhibited the IA-induced expansion of Annexin V
positive cell groups. (a) Annexin V staining (green) was initiated in
individual astrocytes after 1 h 15 min. (b) and (c) represent 1 h 30 min
and 1 h 45 min, respectively: The number of Annexin V positive cells
slowly increased. Clusters of Annexin V positive cells were small and
rare. (d) Left ordinate and curve show the ATP decrease during the
metabolic depression (mean ± SEM, n ¼ 3–7). In relation, bars and
right ordinate illustrate the increase of Annexin V positive cells, calcu-
lated as percent positive cells of the total cell number in a microscopic
ﬁeld (mean ± SEM, n ¼ 3). Subdivisions in bars illustrate how the
positive cells (% of all Annexin V positive cells) distribute into clusters of
deﬁned sizes. The blue bars illustrate the increase of Annexin V pos-
itive cells when IA was instead combined with the control substance
glycyrrhizic acid (Gza). Note the similarity to the results presented for
IA treatment alone in Fig. 6(d). Scale bar in a–c is 100 lm.

Fig. 8 A higher concentration (50 lM) of IA generated ATP depres-
sion in the same time range as 30 lM IA combined with 100 lM Cbx
(curves and left ordinate). Both treatments initiated apoptotic proces-
ses (bars) in the same ATP range. When 30 lM IA was combined with
100 lM Cbx the formation of Annexin V positive clusters was inhibited
and the number of Annexin V positive cells remained low (striped bars,
right ordinate n ¼ 3).
In contrast, 50 lM IA generated increasing
number of Annexin V positive cells during the ATP depression (white
bars, right ordinate n ¼ 3). Data points indicate mean ± SEM. The
ATP data is based on a range of 5–12 and 3–7 separate experiments
for 50 lM IA and 30 lM IA +100 lM Cbx, respectively, and Annexin V
data on 3 separate experiments for each treatments.

Fig. 9 The number of apoptotic units (an isolated positive cell or a
cluster of positive cells) per microscopic ﬁeld was analyzed. Initiation
of apoptotic processes was not inhibited when gap junction commu-
nication was blocked by 100 lM Cbx during the metabolic depression.
Curves and left ordinate show ATP levels (mean ± SEM), bars and
right ordinate show number of apoptotic units in a microscopic ﬁeld
(mean ± SEM). The distribution of units (% of all units) occurring as
either single cells or groups of deﬁned sizes is illustrated within the
IA (30 lM) induced apoptotic processes in an increased
bars. a:
number of foci compared to control. The majority of the units included
more than one cell shown by the divided bars (n ¼ 3–7 and 3–23 for
Annexin V and ATP experiments, respectively). (b) Apoptotic pro-
cesses were initiated in an increased number of foci also in presence
of Cbx (100 lM) during the metabolic depression. Note however, as
shown by the subdivided bars, these units mainly consisted of single
cells (n ¼ 3 and 3–7 for Annexin V and ATP experiments, respect-
ively). The number of apoptotic units in control cultures remained
stable over time at 4.3 ± 0.4 (n ¼ 5).

Fig. 10 When metabolic depression was induced in cultures treated
with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (10 lM), the ATP decrease was initiated
earlier but occurred at a slower rate (curves and left ordinate). Like-
wise, Annexin V positive astrocytes appeared earlier and increased in
number at a slower rate (striped transparent bars, right ordinate) as
compared to IA alone (grey bars, right ordinate). Data points indicate
mean ± SEM. For IA, n ¼ 3–7 and 3–23 for Annexin V and ATP
experiments, respectively. For IA + BAPTA n ¼ 3–4 and 3–5 for
Annexin V and ATP experiments, respectively.

Fig. 11 (a) The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD–FMK
(50 lM) did not affect IA-induced ATP depression (curves and left
ordinate). Neither did the presence of Z-VAD–FMK alter
the
IA-induced increase of Annexin V positive cells (grey and white bars,
respectively, right ordinate). Data points indicate mean ± SEM. For IA,
n ¼ 3–7 and 3–23 for Annexin V and ATP experiments, respectively.
IA + Z-VAD–FMK, n ¼ 3 and 5–6 for Annexin V and ATP
For
experiments, respectively. (b) The number of propidium iodide (PI)
positive cells also being Annexin V positive was related to the total
number of Annexin V positive cells. In the presence of Z-VAD-FMK,
propidium iodide positive cells were observed at an earlier time point
and the distribution was changed (white bars: IA grey bars: IA +
Z-VAD-FMK). Data points indicate mean ± SEM, n ¼ 3–7 and 3 for IA
and IA + Z-VAD-FMK, respectively. To compare mean values, Stu-
dent’s t-test was used. p-values < 0.005 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant and is denoted ***.

of the glia cell family is sometimes especially confusing. Shadowed boxes are the major cell types in 
the brain parenchyma (and are the names of the cells that will be referred to in the review). Microglial 
and  endothelial  cells  are  thought  to  be  of  mesenchymal  origin  while  the  other  cell  types  are  of 
neuroectodermal  origin.  The  choroid  plexus  may  be  regarded  as  a  specialized  outgrowth  of 
ependymocytes making up the blood-CSF barrier.

neuron; green = astrocyte; red = blood vessel and erythrocytes. Arrows indicate the cellular targets that are affected by GH and 
IGF-I. Details are comprehensively described in the main text. 

FIGURE 3. Proposed signaling pathways for IGF-I and GH with regard to cell survival. IGF-I binding to its 
receptor  leads  to  activation  of  the  PI3K/Akt  or  MAPK  (mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  =  extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases, ERK) pathways. Both pathways can stimulate cell survival through activation of 
antiapoptotic substrates (green) such as CREB, HSF-1, IKKα, and NFΚB transcription factors involved in 
cell survival. PI3K activation of Akt can also lead to inhibition of proapoptotic substrates (red) as GSK3β, 
Bad, FKHLR, p53, caspase-3, and caspase-9. The proapoptotic agent GSK3β acts by promoting actions of 
both  nuclear  and  mitochondrial  p53,  which  lead  to  release  of  cytochrome C  and  caspase-3  activation. 
Although GH-R–mediated cell survival pathways remain more uncertain (as indicated by question marks), 
we  have  included  potential  pathways  as  recent  data  indicate  that  GH  may  activate  at  least  the  PI3K/Akt 
pathway at the skeletal muscle (for review, see [211]). Another recently shown possibility in a preadipocyte 
cell  line  is  that  GH-R  cross-activates  the  IGF-I-R  directly  via  JAK-2[195].  These  possibilities  remain 
unproven  for  the  CNS,  but  likely  some  of  these  mechanisms  may  be  active  and  explain  the  manifold 
interactions in the effects of GH and IGF-I in the brain. Abbreviations: PI3K (phosphoinositide-3 kinase),

Fig. 1. Signal transduction mechanisms. ATP binds to P2Y purinergic
receptors in the membrane of the cell activating PLC which catalyses IP3
production from PIP2. IP3 binds synergistically with Ca2+ in receptors on
the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and opens channels
through which Ca2+ ions are secreted in the cytosol. Ca2+ has both
promoting and inhibitory role on its own release. There is also a Ca2+ leak
due to the large Ca2+ concentration gradient. Ca2+ is returned back to the
ER by an ATP dependent pump. As a result of this cascade ATP is
released in the extracellular space. There are two hypotheses about ATP
release (shown in dashed lines): Ca2+-dependent or IP3-dependent ATP

excitable case are shown in panel (a) (k3 ¼ 0:1 mM). The cubic shaped nullcline corresponds to dC=dt ¼ 0. The cubic shape is not sufﬁciently pronounced
although there is a time scale separation. Thus, threshold phenomena are not observed as shown in the two transient simulations of panel (c), where the
system starts from steady-state conditions and a square pulse in time is imposed on [Ca2+]. The duration of the pulse is 5 s and the amplitude is 0.25 mM
for the lower curve and 0.75 mM for the upper curve. Notice that the response in the two cases is proportional to the amplitude of stimuli. On the contrary,
in the excitable case (k3 ¼ 0:05 mM) the cubic shape is sufﬁciently pronounced (panel (b)) and sharp responses are observed for stimuli above a threshold as
shown in panel (d), where again a square pulse of duration 5 s is imposed on the [Ca2+] steady-state concentration. The amplitude for the lower curve is
0.55 mM and for the upper is 0.60 mM. Notice how large a departure from the steady state is invoked by such a small difference between the two stimuli.

Fig. 3. Effect of excitability in the bifurcation structure. Solid lines correspond to stable steady states, dashed, to unstable ones. Filled circles denote stable
limit cycles, open circles unstable ones. In panels (a) and (c) all the attractors and the period of the limit cycles are shown for the non-excitable case
(k3 ¼ 0:10 mM, all other parameters as in Table 1), with respect to IP3 concentration. In panels (b) and (d) the bifurcation diagram and the periods are
shown for the excitable case (k3 ¼ 0:05 mM, all other parameters as in Table 1). In the excitable case frequency-encoded oscillations are observed: the
amplitude remains roughly constant but the period changes noticeably.

Fig. 5 shows the local bifurcation diagram for the four
variables of the system in the case where Ca2+ plays an
activating role in the release of ATP (Cmax ¼ 1:5 mM). The
main bifurcation parameter is the inverse of
the IP3
degradation rate. This choice is due to the availability of
a range of experimentally measured values of this para-

Fig. 4. Interaction diagram for all the species in the Ca2+-dependent ATP
release case. A feedback loop exists since Ca2+ can promote or inhibit
ATP release.

Fig. 5c. However, for values of Ca2+ concentration close to
Cmax, Ca2+ enhances ATP release, thus leading to the
observed increase in the equilibrium ATP concentration.
Furthermore, notice that the ATP and IP3 bifurcation
structures, strikingly resemble that of the Ca2+ subsystem.
A stable sigmoid branch of steady states becomes unstable
at a subcritical Hopf bifurcation which occurs before the
ﬁrst turning point bifurcation. It becomes stable again
through another subcritical Hopf which occurs after the
second turning point. The observed branch of periodic
orbits is generated through an inﬁnite period bifurcation
that occurs right before the knee. The periodic orbits
become unstable through a turning point bifurcation and
they vanish at the second subcritical Hopf. Moreover, the
amplitude of the stable periodic orbits is almost constant
for all species under consideration, while the period varies
signiﬁcantly (results not shown). Thus, for a signiﬁcant
region of the parameter space, the entire system exhibits
frequency-encoded oscillations. In addition, for values of
1=v6 lower than the turning point bifurcation value, the
entire system is excitable. Speciﬁcally, the ATP stimulus
leads to a transient elevation of intracellular IP3 concen-
tration. When the IP3 concentration becomes sufﬁciently
it shifts the Ca2+ dynamics into the oscillatory
large,
regime, thus a Ca2+ spike is produced. This leads to ATP
release into the extracellular space and subsequently IP3 is
regenerated. However, if the IP3 degradation dominates
over the production, no further Ca2+ spikes are observed,
because the IP3 concentration drops below the window that
forces Ca2+ to oscillate. Thus, only excitable behavior is
observed (values of 1=v6 before the knee). On the other
hand, if the IP3 degradation is relatively small compared to
IP3 production, persistent oscillations are observed (values
of 1=v6 in the oscillatory regime).

Fig. 3.

Fig. 5. Bifurcation diagrams for all four species in the Ca2+-dependent ATP release case. The bifurcation structure of the Ca2+ subsystem is inherited to
ATP and IP3. Excitability and frequency encoding are observed for all species. All parameters as in Tables 1–3.

Fig. 6a shows the ATP bifurcation diagram for a different
extent of Ca2+ inhibition (Cmax ¼ 0:5 mM). First, notice
that the steady state now appears in higher concentrations,
because Cmax can be reached and the maximum possible
positive feedback in ATP can be attained. After that, the
steady state falls to lower values because of the inhibitory
effects
effects.
(Cmax ¼ 0:1 mM), a rather
the
steady-state branch appears (Fig. 6b). The cross point of
the folding is not a singular point as it may seem at ﬁrst
glance; it appears this way because of the projection of the
4-dimensional bifurcation structure on a two-dimensional
plane. Fig. 7 explains how strong inhibition creates the
folding. The bottom sketch (Fig. 7e) presents the Ca2+
bifurcation structure. We note the region of Ca2+
concentration where Ca2+ inhibits ATP release for the
chosen value of Cmax, as well as the region where Ca2+
enhances ATP release. The left upper sketch (Fig. 7a) is the
ATP bifurcation diagram, drawn as if no inhibition took
place. Due to the inhibition at values higher than Cmax the
branch above the dashed curve folds and creates the
characteristic ‘‘lasso’’ shown in Fig. 7b. A major effect of
this increasingly inhibitory role of Ca2+ in ATP release
(represented by the lower Cmax values) is that the overall
excitability of the system is suppressed. Thus, despite the
fact that the underlying Ca2+ subsystem remains excitable,
the excitable behavior is no longer inherited to the

Fig. 6. Effect of the extent of Ca2+ inhibition on ATP release as quantiﬁed by parameter Cmax. For Cmax ¼ 0:5 mM (panel a) the ATP steady state shifts to
higher values, since the maximum positive feedback can be achieved, and starts decreasing. For Cmax ¼ 0:1 mM (panel (b)) the inhibition is rather strong
and an interesting folding appears.

Fig. 7. Illustration of how the folding in Fig. 6 is created. The left column panels ((a), (c) and (e)) correspond to the hypothetical case where no Ca2+
inhibition on ATP release is present, while in the right column panels ((b), (d) and (f)) Ca2+ inhibition is included. Panels (e) and (f) present the Ca2+
bifurcation structure. We note the region of Ca2+ concentration where Ca2+ inhibits ATP release for the chosen value of Cmax, as well as the region where
Ca2+ enhances ATP release. Panel (a) shows the ATP bifurcation diagram, drawn as if no inhibition took place. Due to the inhibition at values higher
than Cmax the branch above the dashed curve folds and creates the characteristic ‘‘lasso’’ shown in panel (b). The range of IP3 for which oscillations occur
is the same as the range depicted in Fig. 4b.

Fig. 8. Effect of the ATP Michaelis–Menten degradation rate threshold
(k8). A two-parameter bifurcation k8   1=v6 is shown. Lines denote
turning points and closed circles the Hopf point. Lower values of k8 shift
the right
to lower IP6
degradation rates, thus shrinking the oscillatory regime. At roughly k8 ¼
3:4 mM the Hopf point is trapped inside the turning points and the
oscillatory regime vanishes.

Fig. 9. Effect of the increase of extracellular volume as quantiﬁed by parameter c7. In panel (a) c7 ¼ 0:5 and in (b) c7 ¼ 0:25 (larger extracellular volume
for smaller values of c7). The steady state of ATP shifts to lower values and the stable oscillatory regime vanishes. Thus, excitability is diminished by
dilution because no signiﬁcant amount of IP3 is produced in order to force the Ca2+ subsystem to the oscillatory regime.

Fig. 10. Effect of Ca2+ feedback on IP3 production as quantiﬁed by parameter a5. In panel (a) the bifurcation structure for ATP is presented for a5 ¼ 1,
where the maximum possible feedback is obtained. In panel (b) a two-parameter bifurcation diagram is shown. Solid lines show the turning points, while
closed circles the Hopf point, from which the unstable periodic orbits of panel (a) arise. At around a5 ¼ 0:35 the Hopf point is trapped inside the two
turning points consequently the periodic orbits that arise are destroyed through homoclinic bifurcations before becoming stable.

Fig. 14 and can be understood in terms of the changes of
the slope of the IP3 steady state. As discussed earlier, there
is a speciﬁc IP3 concentration window leading to oscillatory
Ca2+ dynamics (see Fig. 3). If the slope of the IP3 steady-
state concentration is high (ﬁrst case, panels a, b,
I max ¼ 1:5 mM), IP3 exits the regime for which Ca2+
oscillations are observed for higher IP3 degradation rates.
As a result, the oscillatory regime will shrink, while, for
smaller slopes (second case, panels c, d, I max ¼ 0:1 mM) the
oscillatory regime is magniﬁed.

Fig. 13. Interaction diagram in the IP3-dependent ATP release case. The
system now consists a ‘‘master’’ non-excitable ATP–IP3 subsystem, which
drives the ‘‘slave’’ excitable Ca2+ subsystem.

Fig. 15 shows a representative example for the case where
astrocytic communication occurs through the extracellular
(DATP ¼ 350 mm2=s2DIP3 ¼
mode
0 mm2=s). The stimulus is a square pulse (in space) super-
imposed on the basal ATP concentration. Notice the striking
qualitative difference between this wave and the ones
generated in the Ca2+-dependent ATP release
case
(Fig. 11). The wave here vanishes after propagating for
several cell diameters.

Fig. 14. Panels (a) and (b): bifurcation diagrams for ATP and Ca2+ in the IP3-dependent ATP release case parameters as in Tables 1–3. A qualitatively
different picture than in the Ca2+-dependent ATP release case is observed, since ATP exhibits a stable steady state; no frequency-encoded oscillations or
excitability is observed. The effect of strong IP3 inhibition is shown in panels (c) and (d) (I max ¼ 0:1 mM): the ATP steady state drops to lower values and
the oscillatory regime is enlarged.

(approximately 10 cell diameters). Notice the large decrease of the ATP signal in contrast to the modest attenuation of the Ca2+ signal, which is also
experimentally observed. IP3 degradation rate: v6 ¼ 7:2 s21; all other parameters as in Tables 1–3.

separation was 200 ␮m in A and 1 mm in B. The complete SD waves are shown as DC traces for the example in B (1). In two (A, B) enlargements
of the prodromal oscillatory activities are shown as AC-coupled traces. The asterisks mark the ﬁltered residues of the initial DC swings. Signals were
cross-analyzed during the period indicated between vertical dotted lines in the enlargement of AC-coupled traces. Further enlargements of these
periods are shown in 3. Note that because of the movement of SD, the interelectrode distance determines the phase of the prodromal activity picked
up by each electrode. When electrodes are closer (A), ﬁeld oscillations and PSs are recorded simultaneously (A3), while early and late subthreshold
oscillations are recorded when electrodes are more separated (B3). The cross-correlation in A4 indicates a strong temporal correlation with a slight
delay between signals (left inset in A4). The delay is due to the different duration of the components in the respective waveforms (right inset in A4).
Black and gray traces correspond to e1 and e2, respectively. Scale bar⫽10 ms. When electrodes are more distant (B), early (e2) and late (e1) ﬁeld

ings during the initial moments of SD in control and at different times
of drug perfusion are shown. All APs are ﬁred in phase with a PS
(insets in A correspond to the enlargements marked by the horizontal
bars). The two drugs cause a time-dependent decrease in the number
of APs riding at the initial depolarization. Note that even when the cell
ﬁred every two to four PS cycles, the APs are still in phase with them,
accounting for the reduction of
the PS amplitude (compare gray
traces). Subthreshold membrane oscillation of the same frequency as
the extracellular ﬁeld oscillations can be observed before, during and
after AP ﬁring (gray insets in B), and persist even when APs are no
longer ﬁred at long times of FAc perfusion (FAc 83=).

FIG. 1. Neuronal synaptic activity can act
through the astrocyte network to regulate the
cerebrovasculature. The activity of glutamatergic
synapses can regulate astrocytic biochemical sig-
naling through the coactivation of metabotropic
glutamate and purinergic receptors to cause a
phospholipase C-dependent increase in astrocytic
Ca2⫹, which can propagate to the astrocytic end-
foot to exert local actions on the vasculature.
Through the activity of Ca2⫹-sensitive phospho-
lipase A2, accumulated arachidonic acid can
cause vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive actions
through at least two of its metabolic pathways.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX)-dependent accumula-
tion of PGE2 leads to a vasodilation, while the
diffusion of arachidonic acid to the smooth mus-
cle, which contains high levels of CPY4A, leads to
the accumulation of 20-HETE that causes vaso-
constriction. While these two opposing actions
seem in conﬂict, since both have been seen to
occur in vivo, the challenge is to identify the
conditions that select for the respective actions.

FIG. 2. Glutamate released from presynaptic terminals and from astrocytes acts on distinct NMDA receptors. The application of NMDA receptor
subunit-selective pharmacology to mature synapses has shown that synaptic glutamate preferentially acts on NR2A subunit-containing NMDA
receptors in addition to AMPA receptors, while astrocytic glutamate activates NR2B subunit-containing, extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. Here we
show the NR2B-containing receptors in an extrasynaptic locale of the spine. It should be noted that we provide this location for illustrative purposes
as they could equally well be located in the parent dendrite. Activation of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors leads to distinct cellular
responses: synaptic NR2A NMDA receptors lead to CREB activation, AMPA receptor recruitment, and LTP, while NR2B-containing receptors have
opposing actions potentially being involved in LTD, CREB shut-off, as well as promoting the synchronous activation of neurons.

FIG. 3. Astrocyte-derived signals act both
presynaptically and postsynaptically to regu-
late synaptic transmission. The release of glu-
tamate, D-serine, and ATP from astrocytes has
a diversity of synaptic actions. Presynaptically,
glutamate can access metabotropic glutamate
receptors (58) and kainate receptors (120) to
enhance synaptic transmission. Postsynapti-
cally, glutamate can act on extrasynaptic
NMDA receptors to depolarize the neuronal
membrane and promotes neuronal synchrony
(54), while D-serine acts on the glycine-binding
site of NMDA receptors and can regulate syn-
aptic plasticity (159). ATP may also act
postsynaptically on P2X receptors to depolar-
ize the neuronal membrane and regulate the
insertion of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (68).
After hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases to aden-
osine, ATP can have distant action on presyn-
aptic A1 receptors to cause heterosynaptic de-
pression of excitatory synaptic transmission
(164).

Figure 3, and shown in Figure 6B, in which evoking the large eIPSC caused a significant
increase in the number of failures in the meIPSC responses, evoked 100 ms later.

Figure 1.
Application of the neuron-specific System A transporter inhibitor MeAIB does not change
mIPSC amplitude. A, B, This is illustrated by the representative traces comparing mIPSC
recorded in control (Cont) conditions to mIPSC recorded after application of MeAIB (5 mM;
A) and averaged mIPSCs under each condition from the same cell (147 and 228 events in
control and in the presence of MeAIB, respectively;B). C, Cumulative distribution of the same
mIPSC events averaged in B show no effect of 5 mM MeAIB in these minimal activity
conditions. The bar graph in C plots mean median mIPSC amplitudes (amp.) for eight cells
under control (open bar) and MeAIB-exposed (filled bar) conditions, demonstrating no effect
of MeAIB on mIPSC amplitudes.

Figure 2.
Moderate activity (15 min of 50 Hz, 4 pulse bursts 20 s apart) increased eIPSC amplitude in a
glutamate-glutamine cycle-dependent manner. A, eIPSCs are increased after a 15 min period
of moderate burst stimulation (stim). Plotted eIPSC amplitude averaged from a group of six
recorded cells shows that, after the moderate stimulation, eIPSCs increase over control (A; and
traces i and ii; i–iiii are representative traces from one cell averaged over the period indicated).
This effect recovers to control levels after 25–30 min (iiii). B–D, Disruption of the glutamate-
glutamine cycle reverses this effect, generating a reduction in eIPSCs when moderate
stimulation is performed in the presence of the System A transport blocker MeAIB (5 mM;B),
the glutamine synthetase inhibitor MSO (1.5 mM; C), or the astrocyte-specific glutamate uptake

Figure 3.
The eIPSC increase after moderate stimulation is attributable to, in part, increased release
probability, an effect independent of the poststimulus eIPSC reduction caused by disruption
of the glutamate-glutamine cycle. To assess changes in release probability, we performed
paired-pulse stimulation before and after the moderate stimulation protocol. Under control
conditions in A, the increase in amplitude (representative traces A1; thick line) poststimulus
over prestimulus conditions (thin line) is associated with an increase in probability of release.
This is revealed when the traces are normalized (A2) to the initial response (P1), showing a
relative decrease in the poststimuli response; this indicates increased release probability. This
increase in release probability (decrease in P2/P1) was consistent, appearing in every cell tested
(A3; thin line and, from representative trace, dotted line) as well as on average (thick line). In
the same cell from A1, we elicited fast GABA responses with 1 ms local laser-induced release
of CNB-caged GABA (250 μM) before (thin line) and after (thick line) stimulation and found
no change in the representative cell (A4), indicating that postsynaptic GABA receptor
sensitivity was unchanged by the burst stimulus. Interestingly, this increase in release
probability was maintained in the poststim condition when eIPSC amplitude was reduced by
glutamate-glutamine cycle inhibitors (B–D). Despite the eIPSC decrease reflected by the
poststimulus traces (B1–D1), the normalized representative traces (B2–D2) show a similar P2
reduction in poststimulus conditions as found in control (A2). This maintenance of increased
release probability poststimulus is borne out in the group data, showing no difference on
moderate stimulation effect on the P2/P1 ratio between control and in the presence of MeAIB,

Figure 4.
Poststimulation reduction of eIPSCs in MSO can be rescued by exogenous glutamine.
Representative traces (A1) show a small increase in eIPSC size in the presence of 1.5 mM MSO
when glutamine is coapplied. This result is contrasted with peak amplitude decrease in MSO
alone illustrated in A2. Glutamine (5 mM) is ineffective in rescuing glutamine transport blockade
by 5 mM MeAIB (B1, B2), confirming that in the MSO condition, exogenous glutamine is acting
to replace the glutamine lost to reduced glutamine synthetase activity. Cont, Control; Pre-stim,
prestimulation; Post-stim, poststimulation.

Figure 5.
Consistent with a decrease in synaptic GABA release, a weak GABAA antagonist is more
effective after moderate stimulation during glutamate-glutamine cycle disruption. The weak
antagonist TPMPA was transiently applied before and after the moderate stimulus (A, B) at a
concentration (30 μM) titrated to give a 10 –20% block of eIPSCs under control conditions;
group data (C) demonstrate that TPMPA consistently and significantly had an increased
antagonist effect on eIPSC amplitude, suggesting a decrease in GABA available to compete
with TPMPA. In contrast, no change was seen when the high-affinity GABAA receptor
antagonist gabazine (30–60 nM) was used at the same conditions of partial block (D). ***p < .

Figure 6.
Recording and analysis of meIPSCs. A, To determine an appropriate stimulus intensity to elicit
meIPSCs, a set of evoked IPSCs is activated by titrating stimulus intensities (administered
through a patch electrode) to find small all-or-none events. This titration is illustrated as an
increase in the charge transfer of each event (●) from failures at 10 and 12 μA, to no failures
and predominantly large events (>100 pA; inset) at stimulus intensities >16 μA. Within a
narrow range of stimulus intensities, in this case 14 μA, a mixture of failures and small (30
pA; inset) all-or-none events characteristic of meIPSCs are generated. B1, B2 To determine
that the meIPSC response is from a synapse activated during the moderate stimulus protocol
(driven by an alternate large bipolar stimulating electrode), the meIPSC was preceded 100 ms
by the eIPSC (Pair-stim) as described in Materials and Methods, and a change in success rate
(compared with meIPSC stimuli alone; Cont) was assessed to determine whether the two
stimuli interacted. Ten control responses and paired stimuli are overlayed and expanded in
B1 and clearly show a decrease in successful responses in the pairing protocol. B2, This was
true for each cell used in the experiments in Figure 7 (thick line is averaged effect for 8 cells;
dotted line shows cell in B1). ***p < 0.0003.

Figure 7.
meIPSCs are sensitive to disruption of the glutamate-glutamine cycle by MeAIB. A1,
Consistent with an increase in eIPSC size caused by an increase in probability of release,
meIPSCs under control conditions showed no change in potency and a reduction in failures
after the burst stimulation protocol. This is illustrated by the lack of change comparing the
events evoked preceding the moderate stimulation (Pre-stim; left) to events after the stimulation
(Post-stim; right), and by a decrease in the number of failures post-stim (right). The inset
(potency) depicts the average potency (event size excluding failures) before (thin line; mean
of 91 events) and after (thick line; 102 event) stimulation. A2 plots the event area versus
stimulus time for the cell depicted in A1. Note that events are all-or-none and that there is no
change in event area for successes after stimulation but a decrease in failures (evident as a
decrease in 0 pC events). A3, Plot of change in potency and success rate of individual cells

Figure 8.
Natural stimulus patterns reveal multiple interactions between stimulus train frequency and
glutamine availability, which in turn regulate inhibitory efficacy. We used two stimulus
patterns recorded in vivo from a putative inhibitory basket cell, one from a period of high
heterogeneous activity, including bursting over 200 Hz, recorded during sleep and another
pattern of low activity recorded when the animal was awake. Ten seconds of representative
traces induced by the sleep period are shown in A1, evoked in either control conditions (Cont;
top) or in the presence of the glutamine uptake blocker MeAIB (5 mM; below); the stimulation
(Stim) pattern is presented under both. Traces in A2 show at higher resolution that, compared
with controls, there is both an intraburst reduction in IPSCs in 5 mM MeAIB (a, b) occurring
over the millisecond time scale as well as a more general reduction incurred over seconds (c).
Reduced eIPSC size is also reflected in A3 as a significant decrease in charge transfer when
MeAIB and control conditions are compared at 500 ms intervals in six cells. In contrast, in

Figs. 3E,F.). Recently, Takano et al. (2005) have reported that this osmolarity-dependent
release of glutamate by ATP was associated with an increase in volume of the primary astrocyte
cultures in nominally isosmotic medium, and this increase as well as the glutamate efflux
depended on an increase in intracellular Ca2+. The increase could therefore also be indirect
due to activation of a K+
driving force on aspartate, or activation of vesicular release pathways (Haydon and
Carmignoto, 2006). However, the pharmacology of the inhibition of the release (Mongin and
Kimelberg, 2002) argues, to some extent, against this latter possibility.

Hyposmotic solutions cause swelling of astrocytes but not neurons. Two photon laser scanning
microscopy of green fluorescent labeled (GFP) neurons and GFP astrocytes in cortical brain
slices showed that osmotic changes in solution caused IOSs (intrinsic optical signals) that were
not associated with any changes in neuronal volume but were associated with astrocytic
swelling. The panels in column (A) show the changes in light transmittance as hippocampal
brain slices swell or shrink in changing osmolarity. The GFP-labeled (B) soma, (C) dendrites,
and (D) axon terminals of CA1 pyramidal neurons did not change their volume. In contrast
(E) astrocytes showed swelling in hypo-osmotic solution and shrinkage in hyper-osmotic
solution. The light transmittance and fluorescence images were obtained at 10 min after
beginning perfusion with the solutions of different osmolarities, to ensure that a complete
change had occurred in the slice (from Andrew et al., 2006).

The release of glutamate during SD is reduced by NPPB, a blocker of volume-activated chloride
channels. The release of glutamate during SD is reduced by NPPB, a blocker of volume-

the absence of calcium reduced the onset slope of SD. The onset slope is the rate of change of
transmittance during the propagation of SD. (E,F) NPPB also significantly reduced the efflux
of glutamate during SD but did not alter GABA or glutamine efflux rates (from Basarsky et
al., 1999). [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at

Fig. 1 CT and MR images for the spatial and temporal correlation between occurrence of spreading depolarizations and delayed infarct
evolution in Patient 1. In the area of Electrode 6 (channel D), the figure shows a predominantly cortical infarct, which evolved between Days
8 and 9 after several prolonged spreading depolarizations were recorded. (A) CT-topogram showing the left subdural electrode strip;
(B and C) CT on Day 8; (D–F) CT on Day 9; (G–I) MRI using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) pulse sequence, Day 20; (J–L)
Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, Day 20. No major hypodensity is observed in the left lateral frontal and perisylvian region on Day
8 (B and C) (note Electrode 6 in B and E and Electrodes 1–5 in D). The CT of Day 9 (F) demonstrates a large new hypodensity in the left
lateral frontal and perisylvian region, which evolved between the scans of Days 8 and 9. The FLAIR and contrast-enhanced MR images in
(G–L) of Day 20 demonstrate the full extent of the lesions, with band-like signal changes in the left lateral frontal cortex (Electrode
6 location), the perisylvian cortex (corresponding with the global aphasia of the patient), the left posterior MCA territory, and the right
mesial occipital region.

Fig. 2 A close temporal correlation between a series of 4 spreading depolarizations (arrows) and the development of a transient stuporous/
aphasic state in Patient 1 around 10:45 h on Day 5 after SAH. In a thorough neurological exam around 10:30 h, the patient had been
orientated to date, space, person and situation (patient orientated · 4) and no focal neurological deficit had been found. Then, she
spontaneously developed a state in which she did not respond to her name and hardly moved her arms and legs in response to painful
stimuli. The figure demonstrates bipolar recordings between Electrodes 2 and 3 (channel A), 3 and 4 (channel B), 4 and 5 (channel C) and
5 and 6 (channel D) during the change of her mental status. Compare the spatial arrangement of each electrode in relation to the
cortical regions using the CTs of Fig. 1A, B, D and E. The upper four traces show the raw electrocorticographic (ECoG) data which
contain the slow potential shifts of the spreading depolarizations (lower frequency limit of the GT205 amplifier, 0.01 Hz). The lower
four traces give the high-pass filtered electrocorticographic activity (lower frequency limit, 0.5 Hz) in which the spread of the
electrocorticographic depression is observed. The 4 spreading depolarizations propagated from channel D to C (arrows).
The calibration bars for channel D also apply to channels A–C.

Fig. 3 Comparison between a short-lasting spreading depolarization in Patient 1 on Day 4 (A) and two long-lasting spreading depolarizations
on Day 7 (B). The two long-lasting spreading depolarizations accompanied the development of a new right-sided hemiparesis. Bipolar
recordings are demonstrated between Electrodes 2 and 3 (channel A), 3 and 4 (channel B), 4 and 5 (channel C) and 5 and 6 (channel D).
Compare the spatial arrangement of each electrode in relation to the cortical regions using the CTs of Fig. 1A, B, D, E. In A and B, the upper
four traces show the power of the high-pass filtered electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity (lower frequency limit, 0.5 Hz). The lower four
traces show the integral of the power (lower frequency limit, 0.5 Hz; time constant decay, 60s). The integral of the power was used to
calculate the duration of the depression period (* = depression periods). (B) Note the long-lasting depression periods in channel D
(Electrode 5–6), where the new infarct is evolving (compare images of Fig. 1). The calibration bars for channel D also apply to channels A–C.

Fig. 4 On Day 8, the propagation pattern of spreading
depolarizations changed in Patient 1; the spreading depolarizations
now propagated along the whole distance from channel D to
A (representing Electrodes 6–2). The upper five traces are unipolar
recordings from individual electrodes, each referenced to one
ipsilateral subgaleal platinum electrode [raw electrocorticographic
(ECoG) signals]. The slow potential change is thus visualized for
each electrode independently of the others, clearly showing the
propagation (arrows) of the slow potential change from Electrode
6 along the strip to Electrode 2 (distance: 4 cm). The average
propagation velocity was 1.8 mm/min in this example. Note that
these slow potential changes do not represent true direct current
(DC) shifts but are high-pass filtered by the GT205 with a lower
frequency limit of 0.01 Hz. Compare the spatial arrangement of
each electrode in relation to the cortical regions using Fig. 1A, B, D
and E. The lower four traces show the high-pass filtered
electrocorticographic data with a lower frequency limit of 0.5 Hz
of the simultaneous bipolar recordings which allow the visualiza-
tion of the spreading electrocorticographic depression (arrows).
The calibration bar in trace 5, Electrode 6, also applies to traces
1–4 and the calibration bar in trace 9, channel D, also applies
to traces 6–8.

Fig. 5 Temporal relationship between spreading depolarizations and the evolution of an infarct in the anterior cerebral artery territory in
Patient 2. (A) (Day 0) shows the initial CT scan with massive SAH (large arrow) and right frontobasal haematoma (small arrow). (B) (Day 4)
gives bipolar recordings between Electrodes 3 and 4 (channel B), 4 and 5 (channel C) and 5 and 6 (channel D) (names of the channels
and time scale are found in H). In B the raw electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity which contains the slow potential changes is shown in the
upper three traces whereas the high-pass filtered electrocorticographic activity demonstrating the electrocorticographic depression is
shown in the lower three traces (lower frequency limit, 0.5 Hz). The horizontal black arrows and squares in the upper three traces indicate
the propagation from one electrode to the next in detail. Note that in this bipolar recording, a simultaneous slow potential change
with phase reversal in two neighbouring channels originates at the electrode common to the two channels. This is best seen for Electrode 5
in channels D and C. The calibration bar in the third trace also applies to traces 1 and 2; the calibration bar in trace 6 also to traces 4 and 5.
(B) A spreading depolarization with short-lasting electrocorticographic depression (lower three traces) as recorded during the first days
after SAH. The dashed arrow illustrates the direction of propagation of the spreading depolarization from Electrode 6 to 4.
(C) CT at 6 days after SAH and 5 days after surgical haematoma evacuation. Note Electrodes 5 and 4 in the CT. The white arrow in
(C) illustrates the direction of propagation of spreading depolarization from Electrode 6 to 4 along the subdural strip which was observed in
the first 37 spreading depolarizations in this patient [compare the spreading depolarizations in B and D (dashed arrows)]. (D) A spreading
depolarization on Day 8 after SAH. Note that the depression period (lower three traces) is considerably longer compared with that of the
spreading depolarization in B, which is typical of this later time period and suggests some energy compromise (compare
Patient 2 in Fig. 6). Late on Day 8, the direction of propagation of the spreading depolarization suddenly changed and the spreading
depolarization now started mostly from the more anterior electrodes as shown in F (Day 9, 4:25h) and H (Day 9, 6:00 h) (in
3 of 4 spreading depolarizations dashed arrows now point from Electrode 4 to 6). Also, electrocorticographic activity remained depressed
between subsequent spreading depolarizations on Day 9, typical of spreading depolarizations in the ischaemic penumbra in animals.
These changes correlated with the evolution of a new infarct in the territory of the right anterior cerebral artery as shown in E
(Day 9, 15:41 h; asterisk) and the territory of the right MCA (data not shown). The white arrow in the CT of E illustrates the new direction
of propagation of spreading depolarization in this period from Electrode 4 to 6 [corresponding with the first spreading depolarization in
F and both spreading depolarizations in H (dashed arrows)]. (G) An MRI of Day 13 with FLAIR sequence demonstrating the lesions.
Asterisk = delayed brain infarct in the anterior cerebral artery territory; cross = previous recording area. Note that increase of ICP
had necessitated right-sided decompressive hemicraniectomy on Day 10.

Fig. 6 Time correlation of clinical scores and incidence of spreading depolarizations in patients with and without DIND. The figure gives an
overview of 13 of 18 patients who developed spreading depolarization after SAH. No. 1 = Patient 1 etc. (corresponding with table, text and
other figures); asterisk = day of surgery; horizontal black line = recording period; vertical lines = cortical spreading depolarizations (the
length of the vertical lines gives the duration of the depression period in logarithmic scale); light grey-shaded area = clinical DIND (delayed
decrease of consciousness by at least two levels of GCS and/or new focal neurological deficit) without delayed infarct; dark grey-shaded area
= DIND associated with delayed brain infarct; AFND = acute focal neurological deficit due to acute SAH or surgery; GCS = Glasgow Coma
Scale; SPC = pure slow potential change which started within a period of electrocorticographic depression. Patient 2 was sedated
throughout the monitoring period so that clinical assessment was limited. The finding of a new infarct on CT on Day 9 is taken as the onset
of the DIND (compare illustrative case 2).

Fig. 7 Delayed brain infarcts are associated with prolonged
electrocorticographic depression. Patients with delayed
CT-/MRI-proven infarcts showed significantly prolonged
electrocorticographic (ECoG) depression periods during infarct
development at Days 7–9 after SAH (**P = 0.006), whereas early
after SAH, no significant difference was found between patients
who later developed a delayed infarct and those who did not.
Prolongation of the recovery phase of spreading depolarization is
one of the electrocorticographic hallmarks of penumbral spreading
depolarizations in animals.

Figure 1 CSD is associated with marked
changes in NADH signal in cortex of adult mice.
(a) Pseudocolored images of NADH ﬂuorescence
changes during the passage of a wave of CSD
50 mm below the cortical surface. NADH
decreases (dips) are displayed in green-blue and
NADH increases (overshoot) in red-yellow. Dashed
lines indicate the wave front moving across the
ﬁeld. Arrowheads indicate areas with NADH
overshoot. Scale bar, 100 mm. (b) LFP recording
of the CSD wave in a. (c) Time-course relative
changes of NADH ﬂuorescence in dip (green),
overshoot (orange) and integration of the whole
ﬁeld (black) of the CSD wave shown in a. Means
and s.d. were calculated from eight areas of
dip and overshoot in the ﬁeld. (d) Summary
histogram of initial peak NADH ﬂuorescence
changes (mean ± s.e.m.).

Figure 2 The microvasculature determines the
pattern of NADH ﬂuorescence changes during
CSD. (a) NADH ﬂuorescence changes during peak
depolarization (left panel). Intravascular labeling
with FITC-dextran (middle panel) combined with
NADH ﬂuorescence imaging (right panel) shows
that NADH dips strictly colocalized with
capillaries. NADH overshoots occur in
microwatersheds at greater distances from the
capillaries. Scale bar, 100 mm. (b) Comparison
of tissue depolarization and NADH ﬂuorescence
changes in the areas adjacent (o50 mm) to
the recording electrode. (c) Comparison of the
duration of the CSD-evoked DC depolarization, the
duration of NADH dip and overshoot, and the lag
between the onset of NADH ﬂuorescence changes
and the onset of tissue depolarization (mean ±
s.e.m.). (d) The complex pattern of changes in
NADH (dip – overshoot) is triggered by high K+
and not by reduced blood ﬂow. The pattern of
NADH ﬂuorescence changes during CSD (ﬁrst
panel) is distinctly different from the uniform
increase in NADH ﬂuorescence changes evoked
by cardiac arrest before (second panel) or after
(third panel) the anoxic depolarization. Topical
application of 100 mM KCl evokes a mixed
pattern of NADH ﬂuorescence dips and overshoots
(fourth panel) similar to that seen in CSD.
Scale bar, 100 mm.

and pO2 during CSD. (b) A summary histogram of

(c) Changes in EEG, DC potential and tissue
pO2 evoked by cardiac arrest. (d) A histogram
comparing lag between onset of tissue
depolarization and drop of tissue pO2 in CSD and
in cardiac arrest (mean ± s.e.m.). (e) Comparison
of changes in tissue pO2 before and during CSD,
and after cardiac arrest (mean ± s.e.m.,
*P o 0.02, t-test). (f) NADH ﬂuorescence
changes during CSD are modulated by tissue pO2.
Control CSD (left panel) gives rise to the distinct
pattern of NADH dips and overshoots. Super-
fusion of the exposed cortex with oxygenated
aCSF (middle panel) results in a relatively uniform
dip in NADH ﬂuorescence in the same imaging
ﬁeld. Superfusion with deoxygenated aCSF (right
panel, equilibrated with N2) gives rise to a
homogeneous increase in NADH ﬂuorescence
during the passage of a CSD wave. Scale bar,
100 mm. (g) NADH ﬂuorescence in arbitrary
ﬂuorescence unit (AFU) before and during CSD
in perivascular and distant area shown in f. In
controls, NADH ﬂuorescence decreases in
perivascular areas (green lines) and increases in
distant areas (orange lines). When the tissue is
oxygenated, both perivascular and distant area
show decreases in NADH ﬂuorescence.
Superfusion with deoxygenated aCSF increases
the baseline NADH ﬂuorescence, and CSD results
in further increases of NADH in both the
perivascular and distant areas.

followed by oligemia. (a) Time-course images of cross-sectional view of a
penetrating artery during CSD. Scale bar, 10 mm. (b) Comparison of DC-

depolarization, duration of arterial dilation, and latency of onset of
vasodilation and depolarization (mean ± s.e.m.). (d) Maximal vasodilation
during the ﬁrst 2 min of passage of CSD and maximal constriction afterwards
in arteries (diameters 15–20 mm) and veins (diameters 15–30 mm) (mean ±
s.e.m.). (e) Line scan images of capillary perfusion during the passage of
CSD. The velocity with which erythrocytes pass through capillaries mirrors
changes in arterial vessel diameters.

causes a similar dendritic distortion. (d) Marked
increase in cell body volume of YFP-expressing
neurons during CSD. (e) A summary histogram of
maximal area changes in cell bodies of neurons

speciﬁc indicator sulforhodamine 101 do not
experience detectable increases in cell volume
during the passage of a wave of spreading
depression. A general decrease in ﬂuorescence
emission occurs concurrently with the tissue
depolarization, possibly reﬂecting tissue swelling.

GFAP immunolabeling in the MDD subject. Blot immunolabeling of GFAP in depicted in
part B of the figure. Two pairs of subjects, control and MDD, display two bands identified
as GFAP (50kDa) and actin (42kDa). For each pair the ages of the subjects are indicated in
parentheses. Note that GFAP levels from the younger depressed subject are markedly lower
than those of the young control subject, whereas, the older depressed subject has more
GFAP than its matched control. Scatter plot (C) illustrates the significant positive correlation
between areal fraction of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes and age in the prefrontal cortex
of subjects with MDD. Note that lower values for GFAP areal fraction were found in
younger depressed subjects as opposed to older subjects with depression.

Fig. (4).
Hypothetical scheme of the progression of cell pathology in depression from young
adulthood to old age This scheme incorporates the relationships between cellular, glutamate,
glucocorticoid, and neurotrophic factor alterations in depression. It is proposed that a
combination of genetic and environmental (e.g. stress) factors at the early stages of
depressive illness could lead initially to the pathology of glial cells, and consequently to the
pathology of neurons later in life as depressive illness progresses. Among the factors
contributing to early glial pathology might be stress-related elevations in glucocorticoids
and/or a deficiency in neurotrophic and angiogenic factors. It is further proposed that the
loss of glial cells at early stages of depression may lead to decreased expression of glial
glutamate transporters and a concomitant reduction in the uptake of glutamate from the
synaptic cleft. As a consequence, an excess of extracellular glutamate may contribute to
neuronal damage or neuronal death as depressed subjects get older. In light of the ability of
glia to proliferate in response to neuronal injury, it could be hypothesized that neuronal
injury in depression could result in glial proliferation in elderly subjects with depression.
However, other factors (vascular lesions, age-related atrophy of neurons and fiber tracts, and
medical comorbidity) in addition to glial deficits could contribute to neuronal pathology in
older depressed subjects, particularly in those with the first onset of depression in late-life.
Thus, the box “Vascular Lesions” mostly represents a new cohort of patients with late onset
depression who might not have had glial pathology earlier in life (for further details please
refer to the section: “Model of Glial/Neuronal Cell Pathology in Depression”).

Fig. 1. In resting conditions, astrocytic-derived extracellular adenosine maintains a tonic A1 receptor-mediated inhibition of excitatory transmission to decrease noise in
excitatory circuits (upper panel). When a synapse is activated by tetanisation, the A1 receptor-mediated heterosynaptic depression further decreases activity of non-
activated synapses and A2A receptors are selectively recruited in the activated synapse to locally shut-down A1 receptors and promote the potentiation of this synapse. The
upper panel illustrates a resting condition of functioning of a neuronal circuit, where two synapses (in grey) are connected by an astrocytic syncytium (in blue). The
astrocytes tonically release vesicular ATP, which is extracellularly catabolised by ectonucleotidases (E, in violet) forming adenosine that activates A1 receptors (in blue) to
tonically inhibit both excitatory, releasing glutamate (Glu). The lower panel illustrates a condition where one of the synapses (in the left) is activated by a burst of high-
frequency ﬁring. In this synapse, high-frequency stimulation now leads to the release of presynaptic vesicles containing ATP. This ATP is degraded by synaptic ecto-
nucleotidases forming adenosine that is directed to the activation of facilitatory A2A receptors (in red). These A2A receptors facilitate glutamate release and down-regulate
A1 receptors. The overall result is a potentiation of this activated synapse. In parallel, glutamate triggers a heterosynaptic depression. This starts by an NMDA receptor-
dependent activation of interneurons (not presented) to trigger a calcium wave in astrocytes (in yellow). This leads to a greater release of ATP in distal non-activated
synapses. As described for the upper panel, this ATP is catabolised by ecto-nucleotidases and activates A1 receptors to further depress this non-activated synapse.
Therefore, the combined action of A2A receptors in the activated synapse and of A1 receptors in non-activated synapses increase salience of information processing during
a high-frequency train. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.)

progressively decreasing excitability levels. Notice that all
curves converge to some characteristic values as the active
area length tends to inﬁnity. This phenomenon is due to the
fact that gaps that are too far apart behave like solitary gaps;
there is no interaction between them. Consequently, these
characteristic values are the single gap critical lengths. For
example, in Fig. 8共a兲 the excitability level is high enough for
a single gap to exhibit reﬂections. Thus, for the two-gap

Figure 1. The transient heterosynaptic depression is associated with increased paired-pulse ratio
A, schematic illustration of the placement of stimulation and recording electrodes in the stratum radiatum of the
CA1 region. B, sweeps illustrating the long-interval conditioning (5 s, upper) used as control and the short-interval
conditioning (0.5 s, lower) used to elicit the tHeSD. The conditioning input is activated with 3 impulses at 50 Hz as
shown expanded in the left inset. The test input is activated with 2 impulses at 20 Hz as shown expanded in the
right inset. Ca, summation test for synaptic pathway independence. The sum (C + T, left) of the fEPSP evoked from
the conditioning input (C, upper left sweep) and the fEPSP evoked from the test input (T, upper right sweep) is
compared to the fEPSP obtained when activating the two inputs simultaneously (C & T). Since the sum of the two
fEPSPs (C + T) is not larger than the simultaneously evoked fEPSP (C & T) this result indicates that the two synaptic
pathways do not share common synapses. Cb, paired-pulse test for synaptic pathway independence. The fEPSPs
evoked from the test input (T) are shown when activated with (T, left) and without (T, right) the activation of the
conditioning input (C) 50 ms earlier. The absence of a larger (facilitated) test fEPSP with a preceding conditioning
stimulation indicates that the two synaptic pathways do not share common synapses. D, an experiment illustrating
the reversible depression of the fEPSP (ﬁlled circles) and the associated increase in paired-pulse ratio (open squares).
Note that ﬁbre volley remains stable (grey circles). Shaded area indicates short-interval conditioning (0.5 s). Values of
fEPSP initial slope and paired-pulse ratio are normalized to the average value during the long-interval conditioning.
Average fEPSPs taken from the long-, short- and long-interval conditioning, respectively, are shown on top (n = 18
sweeps for each interval). E, graph summarizing 56 experiments such as that shown in A from 21- to 50-day-old-rats.

A, an experiment from a 6-day-old rat illustrating the absence of
transient heterosynaptic depression. Shaded area indicates
short-interval conditioning (0.5 s). Values of fEPSP initial slope and
paired-pulse ratio are normalized to the average value during the
long-interval conditioning. Average fEPSPs taken from the long-,
short- and long-interval conditioning, respectively, are shown on top
(n = 18 sweeps from each interval). B, graph summarizing 26
experiments such as that shown in A from 5- to 10-day-old rats.
C, developmental proﬁle of the transient heterosynaptic depression.
Average change in fEPSP initial slope (ﬁlled circles) and paired-pulse
ratio (open squares) during the short-interval conditioning are plotted
versus postnatal age (n = 5–15 slices per group). Sigmoidal ﬁts
(dashed lines) are included for visual guidance.

Figure 1D shows the result from one typical experiment
from a 21-day-old rat. The short interval conditioning
resulted in a clear depression of the test fEPSP slope
which was associated with an increased paired-pulse
ratio (PPR). Figure 1E summarizes the results from 56
such experiments from 21- to 50-day-old rats. The test
fEPSP was depressed to 76 ± 1.3% of control (n = 56,
P < 0.0001). This tHeSD was accompanied by a 29 ± 2.4%
(n = 56, P < 0.0001) increase of the PPR. The presynaptic
volley was unchanged following a shift to the 0.5 s interval
(102 ± 4%, n = 52, P = 0.52) (Fig. 1E). Prolongation of
the conditioning–test interval to 10 s did not result in
any signiﬁcant increase in the test fEPSP (107 ± 9%,
n = 6, P = 0.5, data not shown), showing that
the
presently examined heterosynaptic depression is transient
on a 5 s scale.

A, the graph illustrates the results of matched comparisons of tHeSD before and after pharmacological inter-
ventions. The ﬁlled bars compare the effect on the fEPSP slope and the open bars compare the effect on the

DPCPX (0.2 μM) on the tHeSD (n = 4).

Fig. 5, LY 341495 (20 μm) prevented the tHeSD and the
associated increase in PPR. In contrast to glutamatergic
transmission onto some interneurons in the CA1 region
(Losonczy et al. 2003), LY 341495 did not affect the fEPSPs
(Table 1) indicating glutamatergic synaptic transmission
onto pyramidal neurons is not tonically inhibited by active
mGluRs.

Fig. 1 illustrates serum levels of S100B and NSE
in control subjects, and in patients at admission and
discharge. We analyzed mainly values at admission and
discharge for each patient rather than during predefined
treatment intervals, because this method takes individual
improvement into account. As hypothesized (Schroeter
et al., 2002) S100B concentrations were higher in
depressive patients compared with control subjects at
admission and discharge (patients at admission 78.3 ±
52.5 ng/l, at discharge 76.4 ± 49.3 ng/l; control subjects

NSE was not statistically different between patients (at

Synaptic transmission in the hippocampus was

radiatum of CA1 decreased to 98.6%±0.5% and

region also declined, as noted by the selective
blockage of the second PS because of recurrent
excitation (Figure 1B, arrowhead). This effect com-
menced 10 to 15 mins after FAc treatment, and once
it began, the depression of the orthodromic PS was

Figure 4 The glial-dependent accumulation of adenosine is a
safety mechanism that preserves neuronal viability by opposing
SD waves. Cell viability in CA1 is quantified by the amplitude of
maximal antidromic PS during the perfusion of FAc (20 mmol/L)
(A). The experiments were grouped depending on whether SD
waves did (filled circles) or did not develop (open circles). The
occurrence of SD waves (normally starting by the end of the first
hour of perfusion) caused an almost
total and irreversible
blockage of the PS in individual experiments. In another group
of experiments, the slices were incubated with FAc (20 mmol/L)
for 2 h in the presence or absence of the general antagonist of
adenosine receptors, 8-SPT, or
the A1-specific antagonist,
DPCPX. The time of onset (B) and frequency (C) of SD waves,
as well as the remaining antidromic PS at the end of the
experiment (D), were analyzed. In the presence of adenosine
antagonists, SD events appear earlier and with higher
frequency. A concomitant higher decrease in the electrical
viability of neurons is observed, when compared with only FAc
treatment. Data represent mean±s.e.m. from n = 6 slices and
3 rats; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

Figure 5 Adenosine released in response to glial intoxication
preserves neuronal viability. The time course of the evoked field
potentials (anti- and orthodromic PS, black and white circles,
respectively) and DC potential (black line) in CA1 during FAc
perfusion are shown. At 95 mins of FAc treatment, 0.1 mmol/L
DPCPX was introduced in the perfusion medium (gray bar).
Note the occurrence of two SD waves, one in a period of only
FAc treatment (black asterisk), inducing a transient inactivation
of the antidromic transmission (during the time length of the SD
episode; black arrow) and followed by the partial recovery of the
a-PS amplitude; and a second one after DPCPX inclusion,
producing the permanent abolition of electrical activity in the
slice. The synaptic transmission was also recovered by the A1
antagonist, shortly before the ignition of the second and lethal
SD event.

Fig. 1 B shows the various communication paths between the astrocytes
and neurons where ATP is the transmission agent between astrocytes; glu-
tamate involved in the different pathways is labeled GluA, GluB, and GluC for
convenience. The processes involved are:

mm, separated by spaces of width 25 mm. The cubes have their centers in the x, y
plane (z ¼ 0) and are aligned parallel to the x axis. ATP diffuses in the
extracellular space and binds to receptors that are uniformly distributed on
the surfaces of the cubes. The neurons are not shown; although there is a one-to-
one correspondence with the astrocytes, their interaction is via glutamate and, as
explained in the text, it is not necessary to explicitly include glutamate diffusion
in the model. Thus their spatial position is not needed for the calculations. (B)
Neuron-astrocyte model network in which astrocytic transmission is effected
by ATP and neuronal transmission by glutamate, as follows: from neuron
to neuron, glutamate (GluC) acting on AMPA receptors; from astrocyte to
neuron, glutamate (GluA) acting on NMDA receptors; from neuron to astrocyte,
glutamate (GluB) acting on metabotropic receptors; from astrocyte to astrocyte,
ATP acting on P2Y receptors. (C) Neuron-astrocyte model network in which
astrocytic transmission is principally effected by GJs, together with a small
component due to released ATP. (The ATP production rate is reduced to one-
tenth of that in the model of part A.) The remainder of the network is as in part A.

Fig. 1 C shows the changes made when communication between the
astrocytes is principally by GJs, with only a small contribution from
ATP diffusion, indicated by the broken lines. Following Hofer et al. (37),
the concentration change in IP3 in astrocyte i due to the GJ with astrocyte

and IK (K2 Ca21-dependent); two Na1 currents (indicated by a single

are the K1, Na1, Ca21, and Cl

by a rectangular pulse of ATP of amplitude 15 mM and

moved to simulate the effects of toxic

of the SD wave, (H) and (I), is little

is only ATP transmission between as-
trocytes, although it is of shorter dura-
tion (compare with Fig. 4, H and I).

and GJs of course blocks SD but still leaves some Ca21 wave
propagation in the astrocyte chain (Fig. 10 F), which, how-
ever, dies out after two more cells in the chain. This occurs
because of the small ATP release maintaining transmission
between the astrocytes (Fig. 10 D) and generating sufﬁcient
IP3 (Fig. 10 E) to continue release of intracellular Ca21 along
the astrocyte chain (Fig. 10 F).

black part indicates the protein coding region. The transgene consists of the −5.4 kb to +6.3 kb S100b genomic sequence with insertion of a cDNA encoding 
Cre recombinase with nuclear localization and poly-A signals (nls-Cre-pA).

Figure 2.  S100b-Cre-mediated  recombination  in  the  adult  brain  (2  month  old).  Cre-mediated  recombination  was  assayed  by  whole  mount 
β-galactosidase (lacZ) staining of parasagittal brain slices from CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre (A) and Cx43 fl/+:S100b-Cre (B) mice. CAG-Δ-Z (Iwasato et al., 
2000, 2004) (A) and Cx43 del/+ (Theis et al., 2001) (B) mice served as positive controls. Note that β-galactosidase is localized in the cytoplasm in (A) 
and in the nucleus in (B). There were no lacZ-positive cells observed in CAG-CAT-Z or Cx43 fl/+ mice (data not shown). (A) In CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre 
mice, cells with weak and/or unclear lacZ staining were observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal CA1-CA3 region, cerebellum, and brainstem. 
Relatively strong lacZ staining was observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In the cerebral cortex of CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre mice, intensive lacZ 
staining forming a layer-like pattern was found (arrows). In the cerebellum, lacZ staining was observed in the Purkinje cell layer, granule cell layer, 
white matter, and deep cerebellar nucleus. (B) LacZ staining of Cx43 fl/+:S100b-Cre mice was the most intensive in the cerebellum as compared to 
positive  controls.  In  the  cerebellum,  lacZ-positive  cells  were  observed  in  Purkinje  cell  layer,  granule  cell  layer,  white  matter,  and  deep  cerebellar 
nucleus,  consistent  with  the  lacZ  staining  pattern  observed  in  CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre  mice  (A).  LacZ-positive  cells  were  also  observed  with  less 
frequency in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem. Scale bar, 1 mm.

old,  n = 2)  in  2  independent  experiments  using  different  mice.  The 
same series of immunoblot analyses showed that Cx43 was reduced 
even more in Cx43 ﬂ /ﬂ :S100b-Cre cerebellum (2.5–3 month old, n = 2) 
to 35.8% and 30.2% (average: 33.0%) of Cx43 ﬂ /ﬂ . Thus, the amount of 
Cx43 in Cx43 ﬂ /ﬂ :S100b-Cre cerebellum was reduced to approximately 
10%  of WT. The  remaining  immunoblot  signals  in  Cx43 ﬂ /ﬂ :S100b-Cre 
cerebellum were likely due to Cx43 expressed in blood vessels where 
S100b-Cre-mediated  recombination  did  not  occur  (data  not  shown) 
and/or  cerebellar  astrocytes  where  recombination  was  incomplete

the cerebral cortex, lacZ immunoreactivity detected as granules (arrowheads in inserts) was localized in neurons (S100B negative and NeuN positive) in 
CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre mice, which corresponds to the intensive lacZ staining forming a layer-like pattern in Figure 2A. In contrast, weak and/or unclear 
lacZ immunoreactivity (arrows in inserts) localizes in astrocytes (S100B-positive and NeuN-negative). LacZ localization both in neurons and astrocytes is 
less frequent in CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre mice compared to that in CAG-Δ-Z. Each insert is a magniﬁ cation of the area indicated by the small box in the 
same panel. (B) LacZ was coexpressed in astrocytes (S100B-positive and NeuN-negative) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre 
mice. LacZ/S100B colocalization was less frequent in CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre compared to that in CAG-Δ-Z. (C) LacZ immunoreactivity in the cerebellum of 
CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre mice localized in astrocytes of the granule cell layer (gcl), Bergmann glial cells in the Purkinje cell layer (arrowheads), and Bergmann 
glial processes in the molecular layer (ml), all of which were S100B-positive and NeuN-negative. No recombination was detected in the cerebellar granule 
cells (S100B-negative and NeuN-positive) or Purkinje cells of CAG-CAT-Z:S100b-Cre mice, in contrast to detectable lacZ immunoreactivity in those cells in 
CAG-Δ-Z mice. Scale bars, 200 µm.

Fig. 1. Exchange and dilution fluxes can influence brain lactate specific activity
The maximal specific activity (SA) of total brain [14C]pyruvate (Pyr) and [14C]lactate (Lac)
derived from blood-borne 1- or 6-14C-labeled glucose (Glc) is half that of [14C]glucose because
only one of the two pyruvate molecules produced from each glucose molecule is labeled (blue
text and arrows). The relative specific activity (RSA) of pyruvate and lactate compared to that
of glucose can be reduced below the theoretical maximum of 0.5 due to (i) degradation of
unlabeled astrocytic glycogen to generate unlabeled pyruvate (gray text and arrows) and (ii)
uptake into brain of unlabeled lactate or pyruvate from blood (red text and arrows) via
monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT, black). Labeled lactate in blood generated by
peripheral organs (green text and arrows) could raise or lower the brain lactate SA, depending
on the plasma lactate SA relative to that in brain. Net release of [14C]lactate (blue line) will
not alter the brain lactate/brain glucose RSA, whereas influx of low SA lactate (red and green
lines in) would reduce brain lactate SA. Exchange (blue line out, red and green lines in) of
labeled lactate generated in brain for unlabeled or poorly-labeled lactate in blood would also
reduce brain lactate SA while maintaining a constant brain lactate concentration. Any release
of [14C]lactate from brain will cause a proportionate underestimation of calculated glucose
utilization rates due to incomplete trapping of 14C metabolites; label trapping occurs mainly
via dilution into the large tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-derived amino acid (Glu, Gln, Asp)
pools.

Fig. 2. Levels of 14C-labeled and unlabeled lactate in brain and lactate relative specific activities
Values are from individual rats sampled during rest, sensory stimulation, or recovery from
generalized sensory stimulation (A, B, C; Dienel et al., 2002), or during unilateral K+-induced
spreading cortical depression or in the contralateral cerebral cortex (D, E, F; Adachi et al.,
1999). Labeled and unlabeled lactate levels (A, D), specific activities (SA) of brain glucose
(squares) and lactate (circles) (B, E), and ratios of specific activities of lactate to those for
glucose (C, F) were determined in each animal. Color codes in B are the same as in A and C,
and those in E correspond to D and F. Linear regression lines were calculated for each data
set.

Fig. 3. Glucose and lactate specific activities in blood and brain
(A) Percent of total 14C dpm recovered in purified glucose (Glc; squares) and purified lactate
(Lac; circles) in each of the four two-minute timed arterial blood samples (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, and
6-8 min) drawn from each of five conscious rats with bilateral K+-induced spreading cortical
depression that were given intravenous bolus injections of [6-14C]glucose (Cruz et al., 1999).
For each of these arterial blood samples the following are also plotted: glucose SA (nCi/μmol;
filled diamonds), lactate SA (nCi/μmol; filled inverted triangles), and the relative specific
activity (RSA) of blood lactate SA to that of blood glucose SA (triangles); the SA ratios were
calculated from respective values in each rat and the mean RSA at each time point is expressed
as percent, i.e., 100(SA lactate/SA glucose). Brain metabolites were not analyzed in this

Fig. 4. Glutamate and glutamine dilutional fluxes and oxidation of minor substrates in astrocytes
and neurons
Metabolism of blood-borne labeled glucose (and other substrates, blue box) labels the
‘large’ (neuronal, blue) glutamate (Glu) compartment and yields a glutamine (Gln)/glutamate
relative specific activity (RSA = SAGln/SAGlu) <1. In contrast, many other substrates (red box)
given intravenously or intracerebrally are preferentially oxidized via the ‘small’ (astrocytic,
red) glutamate compartment and yield a Gln/Glu RSA >1. If the true lactate dilution (Vlac-dil)
is very low, conceivably the dilution of glutamate fractional enrichment may arise secondary
to glutamine dilution. Glutamine dilution is ascribed to glutamine exchange (Vdil-gln) but may
also include oxidative metabolism of various minor substrates in astrocytes. If the true
glutamine dilution in astrocytes is large compared to the true lactate dilution in neurons,
oxidation of minor unlabeled compounds in astrocytes may first dilute the astrocytic glutamine
pool, followed by dilution of the neuronal glutamate pool via the glutamate-glutamine cycle
(black). Note that various compounds enter the TCA cycle at different points (not shown for
clarity). See Discussion and Supplementary Material for more details.

Figure 6B, captures the resulting distribution of each cell type across phenotype and treatment
conditions and the resulting absolute numbers are summarized in Table 1. Statistical analyses
show several main effects as well as interactions between HR-LR phenotype and the impact
of FGF2 treatment on the various cell populations. Beyond the tendency for the basal
differences in total number of BrdU labeled cells described above, HR and LR animals exhibit
basal differences in the number of cells where BrdU is co-labeled with GFAP or neither (Table
1 and Figure 6B). In particular, relative to LRs, HRs show a higher number of new astrocytes
generated in the dentate gyrus [F(1,16)=27.1, p<0.0001] (235 ± 25 in HR vs. 62 ± 4 in LR) and
as shown by post-hoc analysis this is particularly due to the difference in the control groups
(p<0.0001). An interaction effect was also observed on the number of undifferentiated cells
[F(1,16)=9.5, p<0.01] with post-hoc tests revealing that under vehicle conditions LRs show a
higher number of undifferentiated cells (p<0.01) relative to vehicle HRs. FGF2 treatment
resulted in an overall increase in the number of new astrocytes [F(1,16)=33.1, p<.0001] and
new neurons [F(1,16)=20.2, p<0.001] as a main effect, but the impact is different as a function
of HR-LR phenotype. Thus, there were significant interaction effects in the number of newly
generated neurons [F(1,16)=9.7, p<0.01], astrocytes [F(1,16)=9.6, p<.01], as well as
undifferentiated cells [F(1,16)=9.5, p<.01].

illuminated compartment of the LDB (A). Similarly, chronic treatment with FGF2 showed
selective anxiolytic effects in LRs on the EPM as seen by an increase in the percent of open

a dose of 200mg/kg once daily for two days prior to the start of FGF2 treatment. Twenty-four
hours post BrdU labeling animals underwent 21 days of FGF2 treatment. Twenty-one days of
chronic FGF2 treatment significantly increases the survival of adult-born cells in the
hippocampus of LRs as shown by an increase in the number of BrdU labeled cells (A) whereas
no change is seen in HRs. These effects on hippocampal cell genesis where independent of

Fig. 2. Genes with decreased mRNA expression in SZ. Each of these genes is predominately expressed after the terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes (see
text). The mean mRNA expression of each gene within each region for each diagnostic group is expressed as a proportion of the mean of the normal controls, which
was set to 1.0. For these genes there was a main effect of diagnosis in the absence of a signiﬁcant diagnosis by region interaction. (CNP F1,23=15.55, p =.0035;
GALC F1,24=5.27, p=.031; MOG F1,23=4.57, p =.043; MAG F1,22=5.12, p =.034. Degrees of freedom differ because only signiﬁcant covariates were retained
in each ANCOVA. For CNP and MOG, age was signiﬁcant and negative. For MAG, age and PMI were signiﬁcant and negative. For GALC, no potential covariates were
signiﬁcant).

Fig. 3. Genes with increased mRNA expression in SZ. The expression of each gene within each region was normalized to the mean of the control group as in Fig. 2. a) For NG2 the main effect of diagnosis approached
signiﬁcance (F1,22 =3.92,p=.060) and there was a signiﬁcant diagnosis by region interaction (F3,66 =2.95, p= .038) with pH as a signiﬁcant covariate. Separate ANCOVAs for each region revealed a signiﬁcant effect of SZ
only for the Put (F1,24=9.78, p =.004). NG2 is not speciﬁc for OLs but is expressed by OLPs which are bipotential and may differentiate as astrocytes as well as OLs (Zhu et al., 2008). For both astrocyte genes, ALDH1L1
(b) and GFAP (c), pH was the only signiﬁcant covariate. For both genes there was a signiﬁcant main effect of diagnosis (ALDH1L1 F1,23=5.63, p=.026; GFAP F1,22 =4.94,p=.037) in the absence of diagnosis by region
interactions. The dfs differ between ANCOVAs for ALDH1L1 and GFAP because one data point was deleted for GFAP due to a low Ct value (b33).

morphology typical for resting glial cells. Two hours after both ECSS and ECSL, microglia (ECSL; g–h), astrocytes (ECSL; i–j) and NG2+ cells (ECSS; k–l) had slightly shortened
processes, larger cell bodies and appeared darker (indicated by arrows). Images were captured with 20× (a, c, e, g, i, k) and 100× (b, d, f, h, j, l) objectives. Scale bars represent 50 µm

Fig. 1. Schematic diagrams of the model. (A) Input to the terminal from nociceptors leads to Ca2þ
inﬂux and the release of glutamate which binds to AMPA and NMDA
receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. In the model, the densities of AMPA and NMDA receptors have been adjusted so that both give approximately equal contributions, but
this is not crucial and similar results can be obtained with other combinations. Only high frequency action potential ﬁring in the terminal causes the post-synaptic neuron
to ﬁre. (B) Glutamate binds to AMPA receptors on the astrocyte endfeet, leading to the release of ATP from the astrocyte. This binds to P2X7 receptors on the presynaptic
terminal, increasing Ca2þ
inﬂux and hence potentiating glutamate release from the terminal. Once primed by a high frequency burst, the neuron continues to ﬁre under low
frequency input. (C) ATP now also acts on P2X7 receptors on the microglia, leading to the release of TNFa which increases the effectiveness of the AMPA receptors on both
the neuron and astrocyte, as well as potentiating glutamate release from the terminal and acting back on the microglia to increase production of TNFa. (D) Extracellular
pathways used in the full model. There are four compartments: terminal, neuron, astrocyte and microglia. These are all in close proximity, so diffusion in the extracellular
space has been omitted as this would contribute only very minor delays compared to the other processes present.

Fig. 2. Results for the basic model (Fig. 1A). Action potential ﬁring in the post-synaptic neuron during low-frequency trains of impulses (2 Hz) and high-frequency bursts of

concentration due to the release of these ions from IP3-sensitive calcium stores. D,
shows the rise in ATP concentration in the synaptic cleft due to its Ca2þ
-IP3 triggered release from the astrocyte (continuous line; also shown is the rise in concentration of
adenosine in the synaptic cleft due to the enzymatic breakdown of ATP by ATPase, ADPase and ecto-50-nucleotidase located on membranes facing the cleft (broken line).

Fig. 4. The effect on terminal and neuron when astrocytes are present (Fig. 1B). Action potential ﬁring in the post-synaptic neuron during continuous low-frequency
impulses (2 Hz) and high-frequency bursts of impulses (20 Hz for 0.5 s) in presynaptic terminals on the neuron in the presence of presynaptic A1 and P2X7 receptors. A,
continuous low-frequency impulses are interrupted by three bursts (at 40, 50 and 60 s) of impulses giving the changes of Ca2þ
concentration at glutamate release sites;
there is also a slow, non-transient, increase in Ca2þ
due to the action of ATP in the cleft on the presynaptic P2X7 receptors which is only partly off-set by the action of
adenosine in the cleft, derived from ATP there, acting on pre-synaptic A1 receptors. B, concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft due to the Ca2þ
transients and the
slow non-transient increase in Ca2þ
in the nerve terminal shown in A; besides the transient changes in glutamate concentration there is now a small increase in the non-
transient glutamate concentration, indicated by the thicker line on the abscissa. C and D, changes in activation of the postsynaptic AMPA (C) and NMDA (D) receptors due to
the glutamate in the synaptic cleft. Continued activation of these AMPA receptors in (C) and NMDA receptors in (D) is due to the relatively high cleft concentration of
glutamate. E, continual high-frequency ﬁring of action potentials in the post-synaptic neuron (compare with Fig. 2E); these no longer follow the pattern of high-frequency
action potential ﬁring in the nerve terminal but continue without interruption.

Fig. 2A). This leads to enhancement of glutamate release by the
bursts of high-frequency action potential ﬁring in the nerve
terminal, increasing glutamate release during the action potential
bursts, after the ﬁrst burst (Fig. 4B; compare with Fig. 2B). This
increases the activation of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA

Fig. 5. ATP release from astrocytes into the synaptic cleft due to the action of glutamate in the cleft on astrocyte AMPA receptors, during trains and bursts of presynaptic
impulses, in the presence of A1 and P2X7 presynaptic receptors. A, activation of astrocyte AMPA receptors due to the now high concentrations of glutamate in the synaptic
cleft. B shows very little change in concentration of IP3 whereas there is in Ca2þ
(C) in the astrocytes due to activation of their AMPA receptors. D, shows the increase in ATP
in the synaptic cleft, after its release from the astrocytes (continuous line), together with its metabolite adenosine (broken line), now acting on the presynaptic P2 and A1
receptors, respectively, to modulate glutamate release.

Fig. 2E). The result of engaging the astrocyte source of ATP is then
to give sufﬁcient terminal calcium in the exocytotic compartment
so that many presynaptic impulses now release sufﬁcient
glutamate to provide synaptic potentials large enough to ﬁre
action potentials (Fig. 4E). Although a greater number of AMPA
receptors on the astrocytes are excited (Fig. 5A) by this enhanced
release of glutamate (Fig. 4B) this does not lead to much increase
in astrocytic IP3 (Fig. 5B; compare with Fig. 3B) as its production
is dominated by the ATP-IP3 feedback loop. The increased calcium
in the astrocytes is due to the increase in their AMPA receptor
occupation (Fig. 5C).

Fig. 6. The effect on terminal and neuron when astrocytes and microglia are present (Fig. 1C). Action potential ﬁring in the postsynaptic neuron during continuous low-
frequency impulses (2 Hz) and high-frequency bursts of impulses (20 Hz for 0.5 s) in presynaptic terminals on the neuron in the presence of presynaptic A1 and P2X7
receptors and postsynaptic TNF-R1 receptors. A, continuous low-frequency impulses are interrupted by three bursts (at 40, 50 and 60 s) of impulses giving the changes in
Ca2þ
due to the action of ATP in the cleft on the
presynaptic receptors as shown in Fig. 4A. B, concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft is higher than in Fig. 4B since TNFa can increase release from the terminal in
the absence of Ca2þ
—see Eq. (18). C and D, changes in the extent of activated AMPA (C) and NMDA (D) receptors is now due to both glutamate in the synaptic cleft and up-
regulation of the number of these AMPA receptors by the action of TNFa released from microglia on the postsynaptic TNF-R1 receptors. E, continual action potential ﬁring in
the post-synaptic neuron (compare Figs. 2E and 4E); this now occurs at a much higher rate when both glutamate release and AMPA receptors are elevated. F, there is no
change in the extent of ATP or adenosine in the cleft as a consequence of engaging the TNF-R1 receptors (compare with Fig. 5D).

Fig 1. Experimental setup for measuring cortical spreading
depression (CSD) latency in the targeted experimental autoim-
mune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Two Ringer electrodes
were placed at defined distances on the dura caudally (record-
ing electrode 1) and rostrally (recording electrode 2) in rela-
tion to the cortical cytokine injection sites for EAE lesion in-
duction, as well as on the corresponding site of the
contralateral hemisphere. A common reference electrode of the
same type was mounted on the nasal bones (reference elec-
trode). CSD was elicited bilaterally on alternating sites four
times per side from the caudal trepanation by applying KCl
solution. CSD propagation was measured in the posterofrontal
direction. The CSD ⌬latency was defined as the time required
for one CSD wave to pass the distance between the two epi-
cortical recording electrodes. CSD velocity was calculated as
the ratio of distance between the two recording electrodes di-
vided by ⌬latency. Four CSDs were recorded in each animal
with an interval of 20 minutes between two sessions. fEAE ⫽

Fig 2B). To determine whether changes in CSD veloc-
ity might be caused by a direct metabolic effect of cu-
prizone,
independent of the detectable alteration in
cortical myelin or astrocytic reaction, we gave a subset
of animals a cuprizone diet for only 3 days (short-term
experiment). Within this short time span, demyelina-
tion or astrocytic reaction was not evident in histolog-
ical sections (see Supplementary Fig 1). However, mild
but statistical significant increase in numbers of acti-
vated microglia cells could already be noted after cu-
prizone feeding for 3 days (see Supplementary Fig 1).

short-term experiment was 3.91 ⫾

Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic scheme depicting an astrocytic
syncytium. Six astrocytes (Ac1, . . . , Ac6) are completely intercon-
nected via ﬁfteen gap junctions (g.j.) according to the formula
n:2 (n   1). Each astrocyte contacts a neuronal synapse, building
a tripartite synapse in the sense of a glial–neuronal unit. Admit-
tedly, this simple diagram refers only to the elementary compo-
nents and their connections in an astrocytic syncytium.

Fig. 1. Outline of an astrocytic syncytium. Six astrocytes (Ac1, . . ., Ac6) are interconnected via ﬁfteen gap junctions (g.j.) building a complete syncytium. Each astrocyte
contacts a neuronal synapse (tripartite synapse). For the sake of clarity, only one synaptic contact is shown (Sy).

Fig. 3 shows the main effects on synaptic information transmis-
sion if the expression of connexins in the astrocytic syncytium is
downregulated. (For the sake of clarity the function of the various
substances like ions is omitted.) In comparison to an undisturbed
tripartite synapse, depicted in Fig. 2, where the number of recep-
tors and the amount of neurotransmitters is balanced, in the case
of downregulation of the expression of astrocytic connexins, an
upregulation of the expression of astrocytic receptors occurs. If
these receptors are increased, a relative lack of neurotransmitters
arises so that synaptic information transmission is imbalanced.
Most
the overproduction of astrocyte receptors
(acR) leads to a prolonged production of gliotransmitters (GT)
(dashed-dotted line) and, therefore, the negative feedback mecha-
nism is protracted. This could explain symptoms of depressive
retardation of thinking, concentration and motor behavior.

Fig. 2. Model of a tripartite synapse (modiﬁed after [9]). Neurotransmitters (NT) released from the presynapse occupy postsynaptic receptors (poR). In parallel, they occupy
astrocytic receptors (acR) eliciting intracellular increases in Ca2+ concentration in the astrocyte. This increase of Ca2+ causes the release of chemical transmitter from the
astrocyte, called gliotransmitter (GT), that feeds back to the presynaptic terminal, thus modulating synaptic neurotransmission. Since the number of receptors and the
amount of transmitters is equal, the synaptic system is balanced.

Fig. 3. Excess of astrocytic receptors (acR) leads to a synaptic information processing delay responsible for the main symptoms of depression. The downregulation of
connexin protein expression in the astrocytic syncytium may elicit a compensatory upregulation of the expression of astrocytic receptors (acR) leading to an overproduction
of these. This excess of acR causes a relative lack of neurotransmitters (NT) for the occupancy of acR so that the activation of gliotransmitter is prolonged (dashed-dotted line).
In parallel, the activation of the gap junctions in the astrocytic syncytium by NT is also protracted, since the amount of NT is reduced (dashed-dotted line). Moreover, the
negative feedback mechanism exerted by GT is protracted leading to a delay of synaptic information processing, responsible for the main symptoms of depression.

Fig. 4a depicts a dynamic gap junction plaque formation depen-
dent on neuronal activation of gap junctions. The syncytium con-
sists of four astrocytes (Ac1, . . ., Ac4) interconnected via six gap
junctions (g.j.). If gap junctions are frequently activated (indicated
by arrows), they generate a gap junction plaque that positively
feeds back to the pertinent synapses (only one synapse is shown).
In Fig. 4b the same activation pattern leads to reduced and incom-
plete plaque formation, since the gap junction between astrocyte 1
and astrocyte 2 is not expressed (indicated by a cross), because of a
downregulation of the expression of the pertinent connexins. Sup-
posing that gap junctions embody memory structures, such incom-
plete memory structures may be responsible for memory
impairment in depression.

Fig. 4. Incomplete gap junction plaque formation may cause memory impairment in depression. The astrocytic syncytium consists of four astrocytes (Ac1, . . ., Ac4)
interconnected via six gap junctions (g.j.). If gap junctions are frequently activated (indicated by arrows), they form a gap junction plaque that positively feeds back to the
pertinent synapses (only one synapse is shown) (a). In 4b the same activation pattern leads to reduced and incomplete plaque formation, since the gap junction between
Ac1, . . ., Ac2 is not expressed (indicated by a cross), because of a downregulation of the expression of the pertinent connexins. In addition, the feedback of an incomplete gap
junction plaque to synapses is ineffective. Incomplete gap junction plaque formation may cause memory impairment in depression.

Fig. 5. Schematic diagram of an incomplete astrocytic syncytium responsible for memory impairment in depression. The complete structure of the gap junctional network as
outlined in Fig. 1 is shown (a). In the case of downregulation of connexin expression, the structure of the syncytium becomes incomplete, since the expression of connexins or
gap junctions is reduced (crosses). Such a ‘‘leaky” network embodies a syncytiopathy responsible for memory impairment in depression (b).

Fig. 5 gives an example of an incomplete or ‘‘leaky” astrocytic
syncytium caused by downregulation of connexins. The complete
