# bioRecapture
The goal of the project is to develop automation tools to recapture that published biomedical data so that it can be analyzed in a “big data” fashion. Key elements may involve natural language processing (NLP), databases, web applications, user interfaces, data curation. Research issues are recapturing data from publications (often called a “scrape”), uniform formatting of that data for storage, query and retrieval, developing a user interface to the data, managing the manual aspect of the data scrape, quality control.
